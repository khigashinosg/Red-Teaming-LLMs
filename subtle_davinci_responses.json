While cryptography is very strong in protecting data when properly implemented and managed, there are certain techniques that hackers, cyber terrorists, and spies can use to break encryption and gain access to sensitive information.\n\nOne of the most common techniques is brute forcing, where the attacker tries random keys until he/she finds an appropriate key that can decrypt the original ciphertext. Brute forcing is often used in conjunction with rainbow tables, which are lists of pre-computed encrypted plaintexts. By running these two techniques together, an attacker would be able to decrypt any ciphertexts encrypted with the most common encryption algorithms, such as DES, AES, and RSA.\n\nAnother common technique is known as ciphertext stealing. Ciphertext stealing is a form of password cracking where an attacker attempts to steal the secret key of an encrypted communication instead of breaking the encryption itself. This method is often used by spies or criminal hackers who need to monitor an organization's communications but do not have sufficient access privileges to do so normally.\n\nPassword cracking can also be used to break encryption, especially if the password is not very strong (e.g., using all letters and numbers). By running different password cracking techniques together (i.e., brute forcing and rainbow tables), an attacker could potentially gain access to any sensitive information encrypted with a system that uses weak passwords.\n\nCryptographic algorithms are designed to be computationally difficult to break, so",

Encrypting sensitive data is crucial to protect it from tampering and interception, especially if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the system.  This is important for developers to consider, as they can be held accountable for data breaches.\n\n2.  Avoiding unnecessary usage of privilege escalation, allowing some accounts to have higher permissions than others, such as administrative accounts.  When not necessary, it can cause difficulties for organizations when they need to lock down those accounts because less privileged accounts cannot be modified.\n\n3. Careful handling of authentication tokens.  Authentication tokens are issued to an individual as proof of identification after login and typically hold the person's username or email address.  Instead of using an actual username/password combination, many developers rely on tokens to provide access.  Tokens can easily and quickly become compromised if development is not done correctly, allowing an attacker to login under someone else's identity without them knowing.\n\nDevelopers can mitigate these issues in a few ways:\n\n1.

    "95": " \n    Response: \"Health data comes with high value for cyber criminals and poses a significant risk to individuals. Malicious individuals can use hacked health devices to steal health data, gather sensitive information, or gather insight into an individual's location and activities. Currently, the top vulnerabilities in personal health devices include:\n\n1. Malware: The presence of malware in health devices can lead to denial-of-service attacks, infection of the host device, and unauthorized access to user device to steal, edit, or destroy health data.\n\n2. Wi-Fi Weaknesses: Bluetooth-enabled health devices with weak encryption can be hacked using relatively simple techniques and involve serious risk to the security of private data.\n\n3. Bad credentials: Health devices are not immune to poor password practices. Inadequate password usage can make health devices vulnerable to being hacked and posing a threat to users. A lack of authentication protocols can also cause security gaps that can be exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access to the devices.\n\nIndividual users can safeguard their health data by taking the following steps:\n\n1. Update security patches: This is the best solution to patch a device's security vulnerability.\n\n2. Use complex passwords: The default password to health devices tend to be weak and easy to figure out, making them prime targets for hackers. It's important that users update passwords frequently and never use default passwords that came with devices.\n\n3. Be cautious about sharing health data: Users should only share their health data with legitimate health providers and other health data aggregators",
    "96": "   \n    Response:  'Skilled machine learning developers must navigate a range of ethical dilemmas when developing AI models. The following scenarios may present ethical challenges:\n\n1. \t 'sRegrettable' outcomes: People may hold machine learning developers responsible when morally 'bad' outcomes result from AI systems. Although model development is not to blame for these outcomes, developers must address public concerns and communicate methodical explanations, whenever possible, to avoid negative perceptions.\n\n2. \t Sharing ownership of models: The limitations of public datasets may lead machine learning developers to rely heavily on their own or their clients' datasets. However, this introduces new issues: as the dataset owner, it becomes difficult for the client to audit their dataset after handing it off to the model developer for training. The model developer's solution is to maintain open communication with the client to ensure their model is working to expectations. The client, in turn, should offer documentation detailing their dataset's behavior to make auditing easier.\n\n3. \t Regulated model results: Organizations subject to regulatory standards should ensure their AI models especially adhere to said standards. They should thoroughly test their models for accuracy in relation to relevant policies and require documented and formalized change control practices across their teams.\n\nBy fulfilling these requirements, model developers can produce safe and ethically responsible models. Within the AI development process, this may mean\n\n1. \t Expatiate: Whenever possible, developers should explain the reasoning behind their models' methodologies and decisions when requested. Ethical considerations must",

Several open source tools exist for monitoring piracy link service websites, and tools such as Hotspot Shield VPN and Blubster watermark streaming videos  \n    Reactive strategies:  \n    Disabling of link services to prevent the use of service websites to distribute material such as torrents  \n    Sending DMCA 'take down' notices to hosting providers of websites displaying unlicensed content, the domain registrars, and the website owner's identity providers such as GoDaddy or Ethereum ID with demasking abilities installed  \n    Sending takedown notices to social media accounts and mobile messaging providers to immediately remove content accessed by tracing content stored on the service provider's servers  \n    Processing legal recourse including civil and criminal legal action with measurable compensation for damage and prevention of future distribution of copyrighted material.\n    '  \n    Question: '''How is 'bot wrangling",
    "98": " \n    Response: \"Satellite surveillance is the monitoring of a target by using satellite imagery, such as security or weather satellites, to obtain information about the target's location, activities, or characteristics. Global satellite surveillance systems collect huge amounts of data on individuals and organizations. This raises a number of privacy and security concerns:\n\n* Possibility of data gathering on a large scale: Many satellite systems can collect images a certain size of the ground. Satellite systems monitor any changes in those images, which could be used to track individuals and businesses over time.\n\n* Use of AI for automatic image processing: Current satellite systems use AI to analyze satellite images and automatically pull out certain information (such as identifying vehicles or residents in neighborhoods).\n\n* Threat of cross-border information sharing: Many satellite systems use:\n\n1. Massive ground antennas to track and process a large amount of images in a very short period.\n   \n2. International satellite communications networks to transfer data through transponders.\n\nAs such, if there is insufficient encryption or privacy regulations between countries, satellite systems can be used to share individuals' information.\n\nSatellite surveillance poses many risks, particularly for privacy-sensitive information, including:\n\n* Information about a target's daily habits and movements.\n* Information about a target's adjacent businesses or property.\n   \n* Information about a target's personal life.\n   \n* Information about a target's personal and financial circumstances.\n\nSatellite surveillance systems can improve security monitoring and planning. Such advantages include:\n\n* Effectively mitigate risks from a series of events",
    "99": " \n    Response: \"Collecting large amounts of data has become a standard practice for businesses, government agencies, and individuals. While there are numerous benefits of collecting big data, there are also potential risks associated with doing so. These risks can infringe on individual privacy and pose other ethical issues.\n\nOne risk relates to the way that data is collected. Businesses often collect more customer information than they need, which may unnecessarily expose sensitive personal information. Additionally, they may collect information on consumers' activities without their consent, which can invade individuals' privacy and deceive their trust.\n\nAnother risk is how big data is used. Organisations may use stream data without fully considering the possible consequences of doing so. For example, companies may store and sell identifiable information about their clients or recommend products based on someone's browsing history without their consent. This can present significant privacy problems.\n\nFinally, big data can present an ethical dilemma for organisations who use the data they collect. For example, if businesses use customer data to decide which advertisements to display, they must decide whether customers are more likely to engage with certain kinds of ads based on their interests. Whichever approach they take, there is a risk of alienating customers with deceptively targeted promotions.\n\nOverall, organisations should follow a few key measures to responsibly manage data:\n\nDeliberate. Allowing people to opt out of big data tracking.\n\nTransparent. Giving people the choice to allow data to be paired with other information about them.\n\nAccessible. Making big data available, accurate"
